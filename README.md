# GameSquad
The app is used by groups to and browse and decide upon which games to play together. Depending on the size and interests of the group, different games with different multiplayer modes are suggested. Members of the group are able to add games to a list of "possible games". The members can then choose and vote between the games to decide on one to play together.
